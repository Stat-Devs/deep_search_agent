    Based on the research on InnovateTech Solutions and Sarah Chen, I propose the following handoff strategy:
    
    Next Agent: Technical Specialist
    
    Reasoning: Sarah Chen, who is in a Data Analyst/Manager role, has decision-making power within the business when it comes to data analytics and business intelligence. Her technical background and interests align with the areas where our services could best assist InnovateTech Solutions. Thus, having a Technical Specialist to reach out would not only speak directly to her technical understanding but also demonstrate our capability and expertise.
    
    Priority Level: 4/5 - Considering the company's growth phase and needs in the area of data analytics and business intelligence, I evaluate this case as a high-priority lead.
    
    Communication Tone: A communication tone that's technical but with a focus on business outcomes would suit this situation best as both the technical and strategic aspects of data analytics would be addressed.
    
    Follow-up Timeline: I suggest a follow-up timeline of about 3-5 business days after initial contact to demonstrate our responsiveness and eagerness to assist their business.
    
    Transfer details including company and personal research results to the Technical Specialist for next steps.
